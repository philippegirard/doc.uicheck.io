If you already have some Stripe live customers you can skip this page.

At the moment UiCheck works only with Stripe in livemode. This means that you need to add some live customers in your Stripe account to test the integration with UiCheck. 

First go to your Stripe dashboard \([https://dashboard.stripe.com/](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)\) and login with the account you connected to UiCheck. If your Stripe account is not connected to UiCheck, [check out our tutorial.](../create-an-account/connect-your-stripe-account.md)

Go to the Customers page \([https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers)\)

![Stripe customers page](../.gitbook/assets/frame_chrome_mac_light-1%20%281%29.png)

Create a new customer

You now have a Stripe Customer:

Now if you Go back in the UiCheck interface you should see this customer appear.

If you click in the Go button you will be able to see what you customer will see when his billing page will be loaded.

As you can see there is a notice that no plans are available. We are going to fix that in the next step.
