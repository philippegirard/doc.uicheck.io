So you have customers and Billing plans in your Stripe live account. You are able to preview what your customers will see through the preview page. Let's subscribe a customer.

Go to UiCheck home page [https://app.uicheck.io/](https://app.uicheck.io/), Go to the preview section, and Click Go on a customer that is not subscribed to any plan.

You now see the 3 plans we created in the previous steps. Go ahead and click on subscribe on any of these 3 plans.

You are presented with a subscription interface. This is what you customer will see when he will click on one of these button.
