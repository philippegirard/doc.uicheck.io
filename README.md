## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why would I use UiCheck?

**To save time!** Maybe you are creating the newest and wildest SaaS, filming some top of the line video tutorials or starting any kind of subscription based business. 

In a business with subscription revenue, you need a page where your users can manage their billing information, upgrade plan, see their past invoices and update their credit cards. 

Programming a billing management page looks straightforward at first

> Programming my billing page should take an afternoon. Just need to create a Stripe account and integrate their API with my website!

However, the reality is very different. Stripe has a subscription product called Stripe Billing, but you have to get familiar with a lot of their APIs concept before getting productive. Once you get productive, their APIs get updated and you have to keep up with the changes. Finally, you must translate everything in term of UI and buttons, since Stripe does not provide any kind of hosted subscription management portal.

This is where UiCheck comes in to save the day. You embed the following snippet of code on your website:

```markup
<div id="uicheck-embed"></div>
<script>
    window.uicheckSettings = {
            uicheckId: 'uicheck_id',
            customerId: 'stripe_customer_id',
            signature: 'signature',
    }
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.uicheck.io/uicheck.js" async></script>
```

And... you get a personalized subscription management portal for each of your customers üöÄ:
